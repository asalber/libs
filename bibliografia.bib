	abstract = {Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) was combined with some machine learning techniques, such as Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) in order to obtain useful information concerning the classification of olive oil samples (authentication of their geographic origin) and the detection of adulteration. Since the plasma characteristics can depend substantially on the state of a sample (solid, gas or liquid) three different configurations of handling the sample were examined, spray of olive oil, a thin laminar flow and the free surface of few gr of olive oil sample. Then, the effects of experimental parameters, such as the laser energy, the temporal gating conditions (i.e., delay time and integration time) of the CCD detector of the spectrometer, on the plasma characteristics and subsequently on the classification results, were thoroughly investigated and analyzed. The combination of LIBS with the machine learning techniques used, resulted in excellent classification results of the olive oils studied, achieving classification accuracies of 100\%.},

	abstract = {In this paper, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) technique is used for concentration prediction of six elements of Mn, Si, Cu, Fe, Zn, and Mg in seven Al samples by two approaches of artificial neural network (ANN) and standard calibration curve. ANN is utilized as a new technique for determination and classification of various materials and elements in LIBS method. In this study, a few spectra of six aluminum standards with known concentrations are used for training of ANN. It should be noted that the mentioned network is not on trial and error basis, but it is a self-organized network. Calibration curve method, which is implemented in represented paper, determines certain relation between concentration and intensity. Then, the calibration curve and ANN methods obtained by six samples are used for prediction of the elements of the seventh standard sample in order to check the accuracy of these methods and make a comparison. In both approaches, a self-absorption correction is applied for high concentrations species and an improvement in prediction of two methods is seen. Results illustrate that at high concentrations except for Si, ANN shows a better prediction with a lower relative error compared to calibration curve approach after self-absorption correction. Primitive study without any self-absorption correction shows that ANN and calibration curve predictions with the best result are related to Fe with R2 = 0.99 \% having the minimum errors.},

Existing methods are time consuming and require pre-treatment of the sample. For these reasons, the Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) technique has been proposed as an alternative method to reduce bacterial identification times. In this work, spectra were obtained from two types of bacteria: Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, their elemental identification, as well as the use of an artificial neural network for classification among them. As a source of excitation, a compact laser was used in the Q Multi-pulse switch, which favors the intensity of the plasma emission and facilitates detection. The results presented show a clear identification between the two types of bacteria.},

The method allows the precise determination of the samples’ composition even in the presence of relatively large laser fluctuations and matrix effects. To show the strength and robustness of this approach, a number of synthetic LIBS spectra of Cu–Ni binary alloys with different composition were computer-simulated, in correspondence of different plasma temperatures, electron number densities and ablated mass. The CF-LIBS/ANN approach here proposed demonstrated to be capable, after appropriate training, of ‘learning’ the basic physical relations between the experimentally measured line intensities and the plasma parameters. Because of that the composition of the sample can be correctly determined, as in CF-LIBS measurements, but in a much shorter time.},

The dataset consists of LIBS spectra of 138 soil samples belonging to 12 distinct classes. The spectra were acquired with a state-of-the-art LIBS system.

	abstract = {An implementation of a fast, robust, and effective algorithm is inevitable in modern multivariate data analysis (MVDA). The principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm is becoming popular not only in the spectroscopic community because it complies with the qualities mentioned above. PCA is, therefore, often used for the processing of detected multivariate signal (characteristic spectra). Over the past decade, PCA has been adopted by the Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) community and the number of scientific articles referring to PCA steadily increases. The interest in PCA is not caused only by the basic need to obtain a fast data visualization on a lower dimensional scale and to inspect the most prominent variables. Most recently, PCA has also been applied to yield unconventional data analyses, i.e. processing of large scale LIBS maps. However, a rapid development of LIBS-related instrumentation and applications has led to some non-uniform methodologies in the implementation and utilization of MVDA, including PCA. Thus, in this work, we critically assess and elaborate on the approaches to utilize PCA in LIBS data processing. The aim of this article is also to derive some implications and to suggest advice in data preprocessing, visualization, dimensionality reduction, model building, classification, quantification and non-conventional multivariate mapping. This review reflects also other MVDA algorithms than PCA and consequently, presented conclusions and recommendations can be generalized.},

The review is structured in sections, each of which presents a different application: LIBS applied for the diagnosis of some diseases and the follow up of their therapy; LIBS as a tool to provide online feedback for laser surgery and dentistry; LIBS for the detection of exogenous and endogenous substances elements in humans and animals; LIBS applied for the detection of bacteria or viruses in bioaerosols or in clinical settings; and LIBS applied to assess animal health. In addition to applications, such as the analysis of hard calcified tissues and various biological materials analyzed as pellets or powders, this review reports on new research emerging trends likely to play an important role in the future development of the technique as well as in its penetration in the medical field. Three of these are: LIBS-based “liquid biopsy”, that is, cancer diagnosis using fluids such as blood and urine deposited on solid substrates; the use of chemometrics for the discrimination of different tissues; and elemental imaging and mapping of trace elements and nanoparticles in soft tissues.

For the contest, 138 samples were measured using a lab-based LIBS system. In total, the data set consisted of 70,000 spectra, separated into 12 classes according to their elemental composition. Due to its extensivity and complexity, the data set is unique within the LIBS community. The central idea was to simulate the so-called “out-of-sample” classification (i.e. according to similar elemental composition), implying various real-world applications. Even more, it reflects the current level of expertise in the LIBS community and the capability of the LIBS method itself.},
